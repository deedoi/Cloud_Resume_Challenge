#Cloud Resume Challenge on AWS

Created a static website on Amazon S3 with a custom domain and activated on TLS to ensure secure communications. One www.yourdomain.com bucket was created for web hosting, and a yourdomain.com bucket, handled by Route53, was created to redirect user requests without the www. Use CloudFront for ACM security integration and speedy performance.
